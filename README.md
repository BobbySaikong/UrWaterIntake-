**Process**
•	Parse body weight input, from String to double
•	Read dropdown items from temperature and activity level
•	Validate input from bodyweight TextFormField
•	Call calculateWater() function with value from bodyweight,temperature selection value, and activity level value
•	Total water intake(L)  = weight(kg) * 0.065L + 0.5L(if hot) + 0.5L(if active day)

**Output**
